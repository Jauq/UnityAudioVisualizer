# UnityAudioVisualizer
This isn't actually any programming I just wanted somewhere where I can place a particular unity project I made.

The unity build is in the zipped folder, the project is named BuildTest6.exe.
To start press the space bar.
Sorry there is no way to lower volume or to close the project, just press alt-f4 to get rid of it.
